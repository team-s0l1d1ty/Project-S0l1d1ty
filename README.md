## Problem Statement
The downside to a centralized ID management means that it is susceptible to a single source of failure. In event that the central ID provider is made unavailable and rendered
non-recoverable, the central ID provider/agency will not be able to perform trust attestation or authentication of users and devices.

Thus, the solution has to explore adopting a _decentralised model of doing trust attestation_ such as using blockchains, smart contracts and immutable user profiles to ensure that users and devices connecting to government networks are _authorised, authenticated, secured_ and _security posture validated constantly_. New _users and devices can also be added to the blockchain via peer-to-peer validation_.

## Objective of PoC
Our Proof of Concept (PoC) seeks to address the following problems in the problem statement: 
1. adding of new users to blockchain via P2P validation
2. authentication and authorisation to service
3. constant validation of security posture

Although security of user and/or device is not demonstrated in our PoC, a high-level [suggestion](#Suggestion-for-Securing-User-or-Device) has been provided below.
